Simple Morserino-32 QSO Server by hb9fvk (ruedi)

This is a small program in Micropython on esp8266 to run a kind of qso server for Morserino-32.

i used VS Code with PyMakr to Upload Code to a esp8266 Wemos mini D1. Adjust your Wifi Settings. Start your Morserino, send 'hi' and it will send you back a random callsign , followed with ur rst and 3 times a report. 

I will add more features from time to time.

progress so far: <hiscallsign> is a random call sign, <hisrst> random number 1-5 1-n 1-n

you: Morserino
he: qsosrv

you: cq cq de <yourcallsign> k
he: <yourcallsign> de <hiscallsign> <hiscallsign> <hiscallsign> k
you: <hiscallsign> ur rst <hisrst> <hisrst> k
he: r r ur rst <yourst> <yourst> de <yourcallsign> k
