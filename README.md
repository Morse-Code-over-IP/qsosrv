Simple Morserino-32 QSO Server by hb9fvk (ruedi)

This is a small program in Micropython on esp8266 to run a kind of qso server for Morserino-32.

i used VS Code with PyMakr to Upload Code to a esp8266 Wemos mini D1. Adjust your Wifi Settings. Start your Morserino, send 'hi' and it will send you back a random callsign , followed with ur rst and 3 times a report. 

I will add more features from time to time.

You're invited to help out with this small project.
